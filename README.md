# ChatGPT Prompt examples

This Python script utilizes the OpenAI API to generate natural language text based on specific prompts.

To use this script, you will need to set up an OpenAI API key and store it in a .env file using the dotenv package.

The main function get_completion() takes in a prompt as a string and returns generated text based on the OpenAI model specified.

The script includes several prompts as examples, including:

- Creating an Angular functional component
- Evaluating a student's solution to a geometry problem
- Writing a product description for a chair based on technical specifications

To use this script for other prompts, simply modify the prompt variable and call get_completion() with that variable.

Note that the generated text is dependent on the OpenAI model specified and the quality of the prompt provided.
